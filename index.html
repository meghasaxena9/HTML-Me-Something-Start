            <h2>Bhopal, India</h2>
            <p>I was born and brought up in Bhopal. I have finished my schooling and university from here. My parents still live in bhopal. It is known as the City of Lakes, due to presence of various natural and artificial lakes. It is also one of the greenest cities in India. It is the 16th largest city in India and 131st in the world.  It's a beautiful place that I still like to claim as my original home. We returned frequently over the years to visit family friends, and to explore the city.</p>

            <h2>Pune, India</h2>
            <p id="testP">Pune is also known as smart city because most of the Tech companies are here. After my marriage I moved to Pune, and I was working as Teacher Coordinator in one of the international school there. This city is very close to me as we bought our first home there and is the birth place of my kids. The city is also famous for the grand Aga Khan Palace, built in 1892 and now a memorial to Mahatma Gandhi, whose ashes are preserved in the garden. The city leads as the 'veritable heartland' of cultural Maharashtra. Pune also has made its mark as the educational epicenter winning itself the sobriquet, 'The Oxford of the East'. </p>

            <h2>Saint Louis, MO</h2>
            <p>I moved to Saint Louis in 2017 with my family. we live in Chesterfield, suburbs of Saint Louis. Saint Louis is a vibrant metropolis in the heartland of the USA, with its fiercely independent frontier-town roots, layered with Midwest modesty. Commonly referred to as the 'Gateway to the West', this eclectic city is famous for its iconic Gateway Arch, fiercely loyal sports fans, and blues music scene. </p>
